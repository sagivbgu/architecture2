globals (in .bss):
    pointer to the operand stack

globals (in .data):
    debug (0 or 1)
    operand stack size (default: 5. Min: 2, Max: 0xFF)
    current items in stack (start value: 0)

vars on stack (the normal stack):
    operations performed (start value: 0. Max: 2^31)

Subroutines / Functions:
*Calling convention: As in Practical session 3
    Functions get arguments on the stack
    Can destroy registers
    Retrun value - in eax
*All with debug prints

    main -> Sagiv
        Process command line arguments
        Call primary loop
        Print number of operations performed
        Exit
    
    myCalc (Primary loop) -> Zohar
        Initialize operand stack
        Initialize "operations performed" variable
        In a loop:
            Print "calc: "
            Wait for input
            Parse input (Each input line is no more than 80 characters in length)
            If operation: Call its function
            Else (it's a number): Call "Push Hex string number"
    
    Push Hex string number -> Sagiv
        Validate operand stack isn't full
        Ignore leading zeros
        For each 2 Hex digits (from the right):
            Convert string digits to number
            Allocate memory for the node
            Build node: data = number; next = 0
            Update the previous node's "next" to point to the current node
        Push the first node to the operand stack

    Push node to operand stack (might be error) -> Sagiv
    Pop from operand stack (might be error) -> Zohar
    
    Quit -> Zohar
    Add -> Zohar
    Pop-and-print -> Zohar
    Duplicate -> Sagiv
    And -> Zohar
    Or -> Sagiv
    Number of hexadecimal digits ("n" option) -> Sagiv


Allowed C functions:
gets, getchar, fgets, printf, fprintf, fflush, malloc, calloc, free
Note from the assignment description:
    You may use 'stdin' C standard library variable (note that 'FILE * stdin' is
    variable and not constant; so if you use fgets with stdin, you should push
    content of stdin as argument into stack - push dword [stdin]) 

Schedule:
    Make myCalc work -> Zohar
    Push node to operand stack (might be error) -> Sagiv
    Push Hex string number -> Sagiv
Sunday, 17.5.20

    Pop from operand stack (might be error) -> Zohar
    Prevent memory leaks -> Zohar
    And -> Zohar
    Pop-and-print -> Zohar
    Add -> Zohar
    Duplicate -> Sagiv
    Or -> Sagiv
    Number of hexadecimal digits ("n" option) -> Sagiv
Tuesday, 19.5.20

    Debug prints -> Validate in the meeting
Friday, 22.5.20
